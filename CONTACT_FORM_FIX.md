# Contact Form - Fixed and Updated! ‚úÖ

## üêõ Issue Fixed

**Problem**: The contact form was trying to POST to `/contact` route, but Livewire components only support GET/HEAD methods. Form submissions are handled via Livewire's AJAX, not traditional POST.

**Error**: `Method Not Allowed - The POST method is not supported for route contact`

## ‚ú® What Was Changed

### 1. **Updated to Flux UI Components**

Replaced all standard HTML inputs with Flux UI components:

-   `<flux:input>` - For name, email, and subject fields
-   `<flux:textarea>` - For message field
-   `<flux:button>` - For submit button with loading states

### 2. **Fixed Form Submission**

Changed from `wire:submit.prevent` to `wire:submit` to properly handle Livewire form submission without triggering a traditional POST request.

### 3. **Added Flux Scripts**

Added `@fluxScripts` to the guest layout to ensure Flux UI components work properly.

### 4. **Enhanced Loading States**

Implemented proper loading states using `wire:loading` and `wire:target`:

```blade
<span wire:loading.remove wire:target="submitContactForm">Send Message</span>
<span wire:loading wire:target="submitContactForm">Sending...</span>
```

## üìã Files Modified

1. **resources/views/components/ui/contact-form.blade.php** - Updated to use Flux components
2. **resources/views/components/layouts/guest/guest-layout.blade.php** - Added @fluxScripts
3. **MAIL_SETUP_GUIDE.md** - Updated with new features

## üß™ How to Test

### Step 1: Start Your Server

```bash
php artisan serve
```

### Step 2: Visit Contact Page

Navigate to: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/contact`

### Step 3: Test the Form

1. Fill in all fields:

    - Name: Your name
    - Email: Your email
    - Subject: Test message
    - Message: This is a test

2. Click "Send Message"
3. Watch the button change to "Sending..." while processing
4. You should see a **green success message** at the top

### Step 4: Check Email (After Fixing Credentials)

Once you update your `.env` with the correct `MAIL_PASSWORD`, the email will be sent to `info@harvestglow.org`

## üé® What You'll See

### Before Submission:

-   Beautiful Flux UI inputs with labels
-   Primary colored "Send Message" button
-   Smooth focus states on inputs

### During Submission:

-   Button shows "Sending..."
-   Button is disabled (can't double-submit)
-   Form stays interactive

### After Submission:

-   **Success**: Green banner with "Thank you for your message! We'll get back to you soon."
-   **Error**: Red banner with error message (if mail fails)
-   Form fields are cleared on success

## üîß Next Step: Fix Email Authentication

Your form is **fully functional** but emails won't send until you fix the authentication.

Update your `.env` file:

```env
MAIL_MAILER=smtp
MAIL_HOST=smtp.titan.email
MAIL_PORT=465
MAIL_USERNAME=info@harvestglow.org
MAIL_PASSWORD=your-actual-password-here  # ‚Üê FIX THIS
MAIL_ENCRYPTION=ssl
MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS=info@harvestglow.org
MAIL_FROM_NAME="HarvestGlow"
```

Then run:

```bash
php artisan config:clear
```

## ‚úÖ Benefits of Flux UI

1. **Consistent Design** - All inputs match your app's design system
2. **Better UX** - Proper focus states, transitions, and interactions
3. **Accessibility** - Built-in ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation
4. **Validation Display** - Automatic error styling when validation fails
5. **Dark Mode Ready** - Automatically adapts to your theme

## üéØ Current Status

-   ‚úÖ Form renders correctly
-   ‚úÖ Livewire validation works
-   ‚úÖ Loading states functional
-   ‚úÖ Success/error messages display
-   ‚úÖ Form clears after success
-   ‚è≥ **Email sending** - Waiting for correct MAIL_PASSWORD

## üí° Pro Tips

### Testing Without Email

If you want to test without setting up email, you can temporarily use the `log` driver:

```env
MAIL_MAILER=log
```

Then check `storage/logs/laravel.log` to see the email content.

### Prevent Spam

Consider adding reCAPTCHA or rate limiting later:

```php
// In Contact.php
protected $rules = [
    // ... existing rules
    'g-recaptcha-response' => 'required|recaptcha',
];
```

### Queue Emails (Production)

For better performance in production:

```php
Mail::to(config('mail.from.address'))
    ->queue(new ContactMail(...));
```

Just update that password and you're all set!

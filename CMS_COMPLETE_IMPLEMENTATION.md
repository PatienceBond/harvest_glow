## 📊 Database Schema

### Products Table

```sql
- id
- title (required)
- description (required)
- image (nullable) ✅ Optional!
- order (default 0)
- is_active (default true)
- timestamps
```

### Partners Table

```sql
- id
- name (required)
- description (required)
- website (nullable)

## 🚀 Performance Optimizations

All guest pages use **1-hour caching**:

```php
// Cached for 1 hour (3600 seconds)
cache()->remember('home.products', 3600, function () {
    return Product::active()->ordered()->get();
});
```

**Benefits:**

-   ⚡ Fast page loads (data from cache, not DB)
-   💰 Reduced database queries
-   🎯 Auto-refreshes every hour

**To clear cache manually:**

```bash
php artisan cache:clear
```
